// Artifact lint — the anti-slop linter's wire contract.
//
// The daemon has served POST /api/artifacts/lint (and returned the same
// findings inline from POST /api/artifacts/save) since the linter landed,
// but the shape only ever existed as a private type in
// apps/daemon/src/lint-artifact.ts. This file makes it a shared DTO so the
// CLI (`capt lint`) and web surfaces parse one contract instead of
// re-declaring the daemon's internals.
