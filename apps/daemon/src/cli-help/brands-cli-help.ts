export const BRAND_USAGE = `Usage:
  capt brand list [--json]               List extracted brands (id, name, domain, status).
  capt brand extract <url> [--json]      Start an agent-driven brand extraction. Reserves the
  capt brand create <url> [--json]       brand and a backing project with the site open in a
                                       browser tab; open it to run the extraction agent.
                                       --prompt-file <path|-> reads the URL from a file or stdin.
                                       --locale <locale> localizes generated brand.html copy.
  capt brand continue <id> [--json]      Restart the deterministic extraction pass for an
                                       existing brand/project/design-system without creating
                                       a duplicate design system.
  capt brand preview <id> [--json]       Re-render brand.html from the project's current
                                       brand.json so the kit page fills in live during
                                       extraction. --project <projectId> overrides the project.
                                       --locale <locale> overrides the stored brand locale.
  capt brand finalize <id> [--json]      Register the agent's extracted kit (brand.json in the
                                       backing project) as a design system; marks it ready.
                                       --project <projectId> overrides the backing project.
                                       --locale <locale> overrides the stored brand locale.
  capt brand extract-from-html <id> --html-file <path|->
                       [--css-file <path>] [--base-url <url>] [--json]
                                       Re-run extraction against pre-captured rendered HTML
                                       (e.g. a page already loaded past an anti-bot wall),
                                       instead of fetching. --html-file reads from a file or
                                       stdin; --css-file folds in collected stylesheet text.
  capt brand get <id> [--json]           Print one brand's full detail (meta + brand + guide).
  capt brand delete <id> [--json]        Remove a brand and its registered design system.

Output:
  Plain text by default; --json prints raw JSON for any subcommand.
  extract prints "<id>\\t<projectId>" to stdout; continue prints
  "<id>\\t<status>\\t<projectId>\\t<conversationId>"; finalize prints "<id>\\t<name>".

Common options:
  --daemon-url <url>   CapyDesign daemon HTTP base.`;
